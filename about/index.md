<p>
  <strong>I'm a Front End Engineer in San Francisco and I enjoy working with
  Javascript.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Whether working with node.js, THREE.js, React or D3, it
  is fun to see this formerly derided language rise to mega popularity.
  I remember downloading Netscape Navigator 2.0 on my 14.4 modem, the first
  browser to ship with Javascript, and being fascinated by the possibilities of
  adding dynamic interaction to static html files and images.
</p>
<p>
  Aside from Javascript I've worked up and down the stack using everything from
  Perl (way back in the day), PHP, Apache, nginx, AWS, mongodb, MySQL, CSS, SASS, and
  Compass. I'm a big believer in Free Open Source Software and have worked extensively with
  various Content Management Systems, particularly Drupal. I have also created
  production pieces with Photoshop, Illustrator, Flash, Premiere and whatever
  else gets the job done.

<p>
  Over the years working on the web I've found dev blogs to be extremely
  helpful in unearthing answers to super specific, super obscure problems which
  no other resource could help resolve. In that spirit, this blog is meant to
  give back to the &aelig;ther and leave a trail of breadcrumbs for devs who've
  embarked down similar roads.
